# Counter

When you want to display a number with a bit more flair than usual.

## Basic usage
<Playground>
    <Counter start={120} value={0} duration={10} decimals={2} delay={2} prefix="Â£" suffix=" in bank account" />
</Playground>


## Properties
Under the hood this component uses [React CountUp](https://github.com/glennreyes/react-countup). 
Any of its additional [props](https://github.com/glennreyes/react-countup#props) can be added and will be passed down the component.
<PropsTable of={Counter} />
