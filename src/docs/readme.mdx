## Install

### Components
Install the library through npm (or yarn)
```shell
$ npm install --save react-blazeui
```

Then import the various components into React:
```js
import { Container, Grid } from 'react-blazeui';
```

### Stylesheet
You'll also need to import a stylesheet into your project. A build of Blaze UI is included:

```js
import 'react-blazeui/build/static/css/index.css';
```

If you'd prefer you can use the [regular BlazeUI](https://www.blazeui.com/getting-started/install) stylesheet - but Icon components won't work if you do this.
